Due to its high safety focus for a modern systems programming language, Rust is a promising choice for performance-critical applications in die field of High Performance Computing (HPC). This report covers an introduction to the methodology of performance engineering using Rust's still-developing ecosystem. It was done using the concept of problem-based learning, where, using the example of quadratic matrix multiplication, many concepts of performance engineering were explored. This report covers micro benchmarking, full benchmarking, profiling, assembly analysis, compiler optimizations, and an introduction to single-threaded SIMD parallelism as well as multi-threading. While the ecosystem is still experimental and ever-changing, the tooling available is already sufficient for thorough performance analysis.
