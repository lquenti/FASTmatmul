	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5tK5ET6Q1I},
	abstract = {{SIMD} instructions have become increasingly important to speed up algorithms, and Rust now exposes them as intrinsics in the standard library.
However, {SIMD} presents unique challenges, among others: portability, testability, usability, and making sure the compiler indeed generated optimized code.
In this talk, I'll take the angle of using Rust on Android to discuss how to approach and solve these challenges.
